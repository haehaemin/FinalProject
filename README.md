## 2024-1 Advanced Theory on Fields and Particle Final Project

### TODOs

- The final chapter. Needs revision. I feel like I wrote too roughly about Wilson RG and fixed points. I still doubt that the logic leading to Callan-Symmanzik is correct.
- Can we see a conceptual analogy between the $Z$-factor in general renormalization and $\zeta$ in Wilson's chapter? I'm not sure.
- Maybe We should redraw the picture. At least drawing on the iPad
- Polchinski's proof is still not covered. In my opinion, at least the parts that should be covered are: 1. where Polchinski's flow eq is used? 2. what is the intuitive meaning of $V$ 3. what is the definition of norm used to show boundedness?
- Personal question: I need to investigate whether or not there is an impact on momentum rescaling and field rescaling physical observables.
- Aside: I'm a little confused about when you write d/dx (full differential) and when you write partial differential in this paper
